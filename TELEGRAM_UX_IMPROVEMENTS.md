# Telegram Bot UX Improvements

## Problem Identified

User feedback:
> "I found it very painful to type /add then the specific format every time I want to add a transaction"

The bot **already had Clarifai AI integration**, but users didn't know about it! We improved the messaging to showcase this feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/start` Command

## Technical Implementation

### AI Features (Already Working!)

The bot already had these features implemented:

```javascript
// File: src/services/telegramBot.js

// 1. Message handler
this.bot.on('message', async (msg) => {
  if (msg.text && !msg.text.startsWith('/')) {
    await this.handleQuickExpense(msg);
  }
});

// 2. Clarifai AI parsing
async handleQuickExpense(msg) {
  const categories = await Category.find({ user: user._id });
  const result = await clarifaiService.parseTransaction(msg.text, categories);

  if (result.success && result.data.valid) {
    // Save transaction(s)
  }
}
```
